                        </h3>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/andrea8.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Andrea" />
                            Andrea was supposed to be a boy but what a delightful surprise that she wasn't. Born on September 28, 1985 in Mishawaka, Indiana, she weighed in at 7 pounds 13 ounces and was 21 inches long.  It didn't take long for us to see that Andrea had something special going for her. Her schooling took place at Darden Elementary, Clay Middle School, and Clay High School, where she graduated in 2004. She made her dad and I so proud through all those years. Teachers conferences were so much fun – does a parent ever get tired of hearing great stuff about their kid? I think not! Andrea excelled both scholastically and athletically. She never doubted herself then and she never doubts herself now. She tackles everything with gusto and a positive attitude. Her personality makes friends because she loves people and they love her. When she was 11, she was working on Saturdays with her stepdad at a nursing home, entertaining residents. I have to admit, it was difficult to see Andrea set off to Purdue in 2004. I didn't want those years to end. Andrea made the Dean's list all 4 years and graduated in 2008 with a degree in Business Communication. Her summer internships turned into full-time and she now works in a leadership role for Beacon Hill Technologies in Indianapolis, where she continues to prove herself awesome. Now it's time to turn another page and we’re so glad to be adding Kail to our family. We are so proud of both of them and know this is just the beginning of even greater things to come. Love you both. – Mom –</p>

                        <h3>Kail
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/kail-baby.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Kail" />
                            Kail was supposed to be an August baby, but decided he would arrive later. On September 5, 1984, our wait was over - a 9 pound 15 ounce bundle was placed in our arms and forever in our hearts. Dad announced to a weary Mom, "Look what we got!", as the excitement and thrill of having a baby boy after two girls sank in. Kail is the middle child, sandwiched between two older sisters and two younger sisters. We were a crew to behold! We always said that Kail was a man of few words, as his older sisters talked for him for at least his first three years! Maybe it was because he couldn't get a word in edgewise. Kail went to Ireland Elementary, Jasper Middle and High School and was a very good student. The girls would tease him and call him "Science Nerd, Science Nerd" when he did so well in his studies (lovingly of course!). Kail also played soccer and basketball in high school. He worked very hard, was good in everything he tried, and he never gave up. He also liked electricity in 4-H - maybe it was his first step in choosing to study Electrical Engineering at Rose Hulman. He now works at Allison Transmission as a Systems Engineer. Now that Kail and Andrea have found each other and are planning their wedding, we are thrilled once again. But this time we got another girl to add to our crew! Take good care of each other! Love Mom</p>

                    <h3>How We Met</h3>
                        <p>Kail needed a substitute for the indoor spring volleyball tournament game; he needed someone to fill in for the final game of the season. A mutual friend contacted Andrea, knowing that she would be more than willing to help out, as she had recently joined the league and was always ready to play! After setting a few balls to Kail, which he so eagerly smashed to the ground, Andrea introduced herself over at “the bench”. The two talked for a while and she quickly learned that his white “patch” was surprisingly not a birthmark and that he wanted her on his team for good. They soon went on their first date and continue to be a dynamic duo on the court. Oh yah, and they did win the tournament that night. :-) Although that win pales in comparison to the excitement that would follow.</p>
                    <h3>The Engagement</h3>
                        <p>Andrea had to travel for a work event and wanted to spend the weekend before in Nashville, TN. Kail agreed that would be awesome and make for a nice little mini vacation before spending the next week apart. :-( Andrea and Kail had reservations for dinner in downtown Nashville on Saturday night. Before leaving, Kail insisted on bringing the big DSLR camera bag (and tripod, hint, hint) to get a picture of downtown Nashville together. They took the hotel shuttle downtown and started walking around. Kail had the brilliant idea of getting a view of downtown Nashville from the pedestrian bridge overlooking the main skyline. It took a little walking and a little convincing because as soon as they got on the bridge, Kail insisted they get to the other side of the river to find a better spot for the “picture”. After finding THE spot, Andrea got ready for the picture while Kail got the camera setup for a timed photo (he actually started a video). Kail came over while Andrea asked how long it took for the camera to take a picture. He said, “Oh, I don’t know, 10 seconds?”. After waiting, Kail turned towards her and said “Andrea, I love you...” Andrea responded right away “Oh my gosh, what are you doing??” and turned away covering her face. He turned her around, got on one knee, and popped the question. She said YES!!</p>

                <h3>Airfare</h3>
                <p>Larimar Travels is happy to offer air transportation booking service for the wedding guests when booked at the same time as the accommodations.  Unfortunately, we are not able to service the flight needs of those utilizing mile rewards simply because the airlines will not discuss loyalty redemptions with anyone other than the member. If you have miles that you would like to use, feel free to do so. We are still happy to assist you with the land portion of your trip. You will also qualify for all the wedding group amenities and have access to the private events.
                </p>
                <p>Roundtrip airfare to Cancun from most major cities averages approximately $500 per person. Book early to save money and time!</p>
